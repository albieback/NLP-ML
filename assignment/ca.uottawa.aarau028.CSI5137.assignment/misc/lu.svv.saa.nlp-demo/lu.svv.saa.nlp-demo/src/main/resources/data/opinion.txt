I know it's not possible at the moment specially with all the hardware limitations but if you guys really are working on a surface phone bringing visual studio to it will be so huge.
The application will exit AWFUL BUGGGG!!!
Having an API allowing getting the color of the pixels under a pointer (eventually throttled/async and only when having pointer capture on) would increase the expressiveness of the creation tools in UWP applications.
I am manually having to keep a list of these when it would be easily managed in the Dashboard if the status properly reflected this.
I did a research on AudioFrameOutputNode It is strange that it often generate AudioFrame without any audio data the AudioFrame's Duration property is 0 miliseconds but the RelativeTime property is not.
I like the ease of the app and recommend this app to all.
I have largely ignored this is the past because it was minimal but someone is finding good success with it so they're hammering everyone.
I've started to continually download review reports to just have a record of them
I've had over fifty 4+ star reviews simply disappear never to be seen again.
I see the point that insiders shouldn't bring down the ratings of the app if the OS is to blame.... but with so few people rating anyway and most people being on the fast insider ring it makes it extremely hard to get reviews.
I have bound the IsPaneOpen of my SplitView to a property in my ViewModel.
We shouln't have to relly on workaround like this one: https://www.pedrolamas.com/2015/11/02/cultureinfo-changes-in-uwp/

It makes UWP apps look worse than desktop apps on standard DPI screens.

I guess it is result of extremely short quantum size (10ms; even switching between threads could take more time) and too low buffer length (2 quants) but it could be just some synchronization issue.
I have an app where I use a custom title bar by extending my view into the title bar area:
Then I also use code like this to allow a custom element to support dragging of the window:
I confirmed that in pre-Anniversary Update these properties would return values like 32 for Height and 188 for SystemOverlayRightInset.
I am working on Location based appppppps.
I am using MapIcon to show user current location.
Yes I know if we're C++ developers we can use the traditional Winsock API setsockopt() can do what we need but that will tied us to the old self-manage threads model which is not pleasing.

It will be awful for the user to find these kind of folders too.
I am adding some screenshots too.
I can use Fiddler on my desktop to view my network traffic.
I run the converter on powershell but it can not finish the work though it doesn't report any problems.
We have several Instruments that implement an API via SOAP on Linux that presents as a WCF service.
Unfortunately we can't create UWP apps because there is no support for the custom WCF binding - which is needed - to talk to these instruments.

We expected this will be solved in windows 10  but not yet.
Till now many clients for my company left out windows and they moved to iOS and Android.
I have raised many questions related to this in community forum.
I'm not sure you guys will have a look on this quickly or not.
It is crazy that such basic functionality is not currently supported almost every device on the planet supports this other than windows phone.
I am having difficulty testing an In App Purchase that is successful with Microsoft's servers yet somehow my app never receives that success message.
We have made a private test app and we use real money to test IAP.
This makes it hard to test when there is a $ cost to every test we perform.
I would prefer to be able to test IAP hundreds of times without having to attempt to get a refund for thousands of dollars.
Apple and Google are sooooo great!!

I hope I can set my App price is $0.2 but I can't now.
Currently there is no way to schedule recurring notifications using ScheduledToastNotification.
But this is simply not an elegant solution...
All Win32 Mac Linux have API's to do so but UWP doesn't.
When you have a text editor with unsaved changes the standard behavior is to ask the user what to do before closing.
This is not possible on UWP.
Today I have run into a problem with ComboBox control.

I think its a bug.
I would prefer it return a boolean or an enum with the Fail reason.
Some apps don't wooooooork in background well.
Downloads may breaks when apps switched.
Currently when the publisher name is chosen during signup a publisher id is derived from that.
This publisher id is then used to name the app packages and the apps LocalStorage folder.

Right now we can only inspect the server certificate after a request was done by using 'RequestMessage.TransportInformation'.

The strange is that when we open the appbar it seems to be partially covered.
